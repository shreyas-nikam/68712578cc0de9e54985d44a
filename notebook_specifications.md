## 2. Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations

Operational risk modeling necessitates defining homogenous Units of Measure (UoMs) to ensure model stability and precision. Grouping diverse operational risks into homogeneous units is a critical initial step. An appropriate UoM selection balances data sufficiency with model complexity and stability [1, p. 14].

Two primary strategies for grouping operational losses are explored: business knowledge grouping and statistical clustering, which can also be combined.

### Business Knowledge Grouping

This strategy involves manually grouping raw UoMs based on predefined business rules, such as combining all 'Fraud' losses or 'IT Failures' regardless of the specific business line. An example could be merging all 'Damage to Physical Assets' (DPA) risks in the same geographic location into a single UoM [1, p. 15].

### Statistical Clustering

Statistical clustering groups UoMs based on the similarity of their severity distributions. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is employed to quantify the distance between empirical severity distributions of different UoMs. For two UoMs, $i$ and $j$, with $n_i$ and $n_j$ losses respectively, and empirical cumulative distribution functions $F_i(x)$ and $F_j(x)$, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance $d_{ij}$ is defined as:

$$d_{ij} = \frac{n_i n_j}{n_i+n_j} \sup_X |F_i(x) - F_j(x)|$$

Here, $\sup_X$ denotes the supremum (largest value) over all possible loss amounts $X$. Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means on derived features, or hierarchical clustering using this distance directly) can then use this metric to group UoMs into a specified number of clusters [1, p. 15].

### Combined Approach

A combined approach leverages both business knowledge and statistical clustering. Business rules can introduce overrides or weight adjustments to the statistical distance metric. For instance, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between specific predefined groupings (e.g., 'Damage to Physical Assets') might be reduced to encourage their clustering. The adjusted distance $\tilde{d}_{ij}$ is given by:

$$\tilde{d}_{ij} = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{2} d_{ij} & \text{if units i and j are DPA} \\ d_{ij} & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

This modification makes it more probable for the specified units (e.g., DPA) to be assigned to the same cluster, reflecting a business preference [1, p. 15].

### Homogeneity Assessment

The homogeneity of grouped UoMs is assessed by visualizing the Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) of their underlying raw UoMs. Statistical measures of dispersion, such as the variance of severity parameters (e.g., mean and standard deviation of log-losses) or average pairwise KS distance, will also be provided to quantify homogeneity within each grouped UoM.

## 3. Code Requirements

### Expected Libraries

The following open-source Python libraries (from PyPI) are expected to be used:
*   `numpy`: For numerical operations, especially synthetic data generation and statistical calculations.
*   `pandas`: For data manipulation and structuring (DataFrames).
*   `scipy.stats`: For statistical distributions (e.g., log-normal, log-logistic for severity) and statistical tests (e.g., `ks_2samp` for Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).
*   `sklearn.cluster`: For clustering algorithms (e.g., `KMeans`).
*   `scipy.cluster.hierarchy`: For hierarchical clustering, which can directly use a precomputed distance matrix.
*   `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn`: For data visualization (charts, plots, heatmaps).
*   `ipywidgets`: For interactive controls (sliders, dropdowns) to enable user interaction.

### Input Data Expectation

The notebook will operate on synthetic operational loss data. This data will be generated internally to simulate multiple 'raw' Units of Measure (UoMs), each with distinct frequency and severity characteristics. The dataset will include:
*   `uom_id`: Categorical identifier for each raw UoM.
*   `loss_amount`: Numeric field representing the loss severity.
*   `loss_date`: Time-series field (e.g., for unique loss identification or potential future trend analysis).
*   `event_type`: Categorical field (e.g., 'Fraud', 'IT Failure', 'Damage to Physical Assets') for business knowledge grouping.
*   `business_line`: Categorical field (e.g., 'Retail Banking', 'Corporate Finance') for further UoM differentiation.

**Data Handling & Validation**: Prior to analysis, the generated data will undergo validation to confirm expected column names, data types, and primary-key uniqueness (if a `loss_id` is generated). Critical fields will be asserted for no missing values, and summary statistics for numeric columns will be logged. An optional lightweight sample (up to 5 MB) will be provided, allowing the notebook to run efficiently even if the user omits full data generation.

### User Parameters

Interactive controls will be provided for users to adjust key parameters. These parameters will be implemented using `ipywidgets`.
*   **Number of Raw UoMs**: Slider/Text input to specify the count of initial synthetic UoMs (e.g., 5 to 20).
*   **Loss Events per Raw UoM**: Slider/Text input to control the number of loss events generated for each raw UoM (e.g., 100 to 1000).
*   **Severity Distribution Parameters**: Text inputs or sliders for `mean` and `standard deviation` of the underlying log-normal distribution for the synthetic loss data, allowing the specification of a range of parameters from which individual raw UoM parameters are drawn, mimicking diversity.
*   **Grouping Strategy**: Dropdown menu to select: `Business Knowledge`, `Statistical Clustering`, `Combined Approach`.
*   **Number of Clusters (for Statistical/Combined)**: Slider/Text input to specify `k` for clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means). This parameter will be visible only when `Statistical Clustering` or `Combined Approach` is selected.
*   **Business Rule Event Types (for Business/Combined)**: Multi-select dropdown or text input to define which `event_type` categories should be grouped by business knowledge (e.g., 'Damage to Physical Assets'). This will be visible when `Business Knowledge` or `Combined Approach` is selected.

### Logical Flow & Algorithms

The notebook's logical flow will proceed as follows:

1.  **Synthetic Data Generation**:
    *   **Purpose**: Create a synthetic dataset of operational loss events for a specified number of 'raw' UoMs, each with slightly varying frequency and severity characteristics.
    *   **Algorithm**:
        *   Generate `N` unique `uom_id`s, assigning random `event_type` and `business_line` combinations.
        *   For each `uom_id`:
            *   Simulate loss frequencies (number of loss events) from a Poisson distribution.
            *   Simulate loss severities for each event from a heavy-tailed distribution (e.g., Log-Normal or Log-Logistic), drawing distribution parameters (e.g., mean and standard deviation of log-losses) from a defined range to introduce diversity across UoMs.
        *   Combine all generated losses into a single Pandas DataFrame with columns: `uom_id`, `loss_amount`, `loss_date`, `event_type`, `business_line`.

2.  **Data Preprocessing & Exploratory Analysis**:
    *   **Purpose**: Prepare the generated data for grouping and visualize initial similarities/differences between raw UoMs.
    *   **Algorithm**:
        *   For each raw UoM, compute its empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of loss severities.
        *   Calculate the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distance between the empirical CDFs of all pairs of raw UoMs.
        *   Store these distances in a symmetric distance matrix.
        *   Display a heatmap of the calculated KS distances to visually identify natural clusters among raw UoMs.

3.  **UoM Grouping Strategies**:
    *   **Purpose**: Apply the user-selected strategy to group raw UoMs into homogenous units.
    *   **Algorithm**:
        *   **Strategy Selection**: An `if-elif-else` structure will control the execution based on the user's `Grouping Strategy` selection.
        *   **Business Knowledge Grouping**:
            *   Group raw UoMs based on the specified `event_type` (e.g., all UoMs with `event_type` 'Damage to Physical Assets' form one group). Other UoMs may be grouped by their unique `event_type` + `business_line` combination, or remain as individual UoMs if no specific rule applies.
            *   Assign a new `grouped_uom_id` to the resulting groups.
        *   **Statistical Clustering**:
            *   For each raw UoM, extract representative features from its severity distribution. This could involve:
                *   Estimating parameters of a fitted distribution (e.g., mean and standard deviation of log-losses for a log-normal fit).
                *   Extracting a set of quantiles (e.g., 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th percentiles) from the empirical CDF.
            *   Apply the K-means clustering algorithm on these feature vectors, with the user-defined `Number of Clusters`.
            *   Assign a `grouped_uom_id` based on the cluster assignments.
        *   **Combined Approach**:
            *   Compute a modified KS distance matrix: for pairs of raw UoMs that are subject to a business rule grouping (e.g., both are 'Damage to Physical Assets'), their KS distance will be reduced (e.g., multiplied by 0.5) before clustering.
            *   Apply a clustering algorithm (e.g., Hierarchical Clustering with `linkage` method, which can directly use a precomputed distance matrix) on this modified distance matrix, using the user-defined `Number of Clusters`.
            *   Assign a `grouped_uom_id` based on the resulting clusters.

4.  **Homogeneity Assessment & Visualization**:
    *   **Purpose**: Evaluate the homogeneity within each newly formed grouped UoM, both visually and statistically.
    *   **Algorithm**:
        *   For each unique `grouped_uom_id`:
            *   Identify all `raw_uom_id`s that belong to this group.
            *   **Visual Assessment**: Plot the empirical CDFs of the loss severities for all constituent `raw_uom_id`s on a single chart. Each raw UoM's CDF should be distinctively colored or styled.
            *   **Statistical Assessment**:
                *   Calculate statistical measures of dispersion for the severity characteristics across the `raw_uom_id`s within the group (e.g., variance of mean log-losses, variance of standard deviation of log-losses, or average pairwise KS distance within the group).
                *   Display these metrics alongside the CDF plots.

5.  **Output Summary**:
    *   **Purpose**: Present a clear summary of the grouping results and homogeneity analysis.
    *   **Algorithm**:
        *   Display a table mapping each original `raw_uom_id` to its newly assigned `grouped_uom_id`.
        *   Provide a summary table for each `grouped_uom_id`, including the list of its constituent `raw_uom_id`s and the calculated homogeneity metrics.

### Visualization Requirements

The notebook will generate various visualizations to aid understanding:
*   **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Distance Heatmap**: A heatmap displaying the KS distances between all initial synthetic raw UoMs (before grouping) to visually identify natural clusters. It will feature clear axes labels and a color bar.
*   **Empirical CDF Plots**: For each resulting grouped UoM, a dedicated plot showing the empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) of all raw UoMs belonging to that group. Each raw UoM's CDF will be represented by a distinct line with a clear legend, allowing for visual assessment of homogeneity.
*   **Summary Tables**: Well-formatted tables presenting the grouping assignments and quantitative homogeneity metrics (e.g., average KS distance within groups, variance of severity parameters) for each grouped UoM.

**Style & Usability**:
*   Adopt a color-blind-friendly palette.
*   Font size $\ge 12$ pt for readability in all plots.
*   Supply clear titles, labeled axes, and legends for all visuals.
*   Enable interactivity where the environment supports it (e.g., using `ipywidgets` for controls and potentially `plotly` or `bokeh` for interactive plots if chosen, with static `matplotlib`/`seaborn` fallbacks saved as PNGs).

## 4. Additional Notes or Instructions

### Assumptions

The following assumptions are made for the implementation:
*   Synthetic data generation will aim to mimic typical operational loss data characteristics (e.g., heavy-tailed severity distributions and varying frequencies across UoMs).
*   The 'Business Knowledge Grouping' rules will be illustrative and configurable, rather than attempting to model an exhaustive real-world operational risk taxonomy.
*   For statistical clustering using K-means, features derived from the severity distributions (e.g., empirical quantiles or estimated distribution parameters) will be used as input to the algorithm. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance is used as the primary metric for pairwise similarity assessment and subsequent homogeneity evaluation. Hierarchical clustering is considered a viable alternative that can directly use the KS distance matrix.

### Constraints

The notebook is designed to operate under the following constraints:
*   **Performance**: The entire lab must execute end-to-end on a mid-spec laptop (8 GB RAM) in fewer than 5 minutes.
*   **Libraries**: Only open-source Python libraries from PyPI are permitted for all computations and visualizations.

### Customization

Users are encouraged to interact with the provided parameters to customize the analysis:
*   Experiment with different numbers of raw UoMs and loss counts per UoM to observe the impact on data characteristics and subsequent grouping.
*   Adjust severity distribution parameters to create more or less diverse initial raw UoMs, simulating different risk profiles.
*   Vary the grouping strategy and the number of clusters (`k`) to explore how UoMs are formed and their resulting homogeneity.
*   Inline help text or tooltips will be provided for each interactive control to guide users on its function and impact.

### Narrative and Comments

All major steps within the notebook will include both concise markdown narrative cells describing **what** is happening and **why**, alongside detailed code comments to explain the implementation logic. This ensures clarity for learners at every stage.
